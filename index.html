  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a results-driven Senior Technical Program Manager with over 15 years of experience turning complex technical challenges into streamlined business solutions. I specialize in leading cross-functional teams through high-stakes digital transformations, from multi-state product launches to enterprise-scale system integrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach is simple: understand the business goal, align the right people, and execute with precision. I've built my career on the ability to translate between technical teams and business stakeholders, ensuring everyone stays focused on what actually moves the needle. Whether it's launching a product in 7 new markets or integrating systems from a $100B acquisition, I thrive in environments where the stakes are high and the path forward isn't always clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sets me apart is my combination of deep technical understanding and business acumen. I don't just manage timelines—I help shape strategy, identify risks before they become problems, and build processes that scale. My teams consistently deliver on time and under budget because I focus on the fundamentals: clear communication, smart prioritization, and relentless execution.
